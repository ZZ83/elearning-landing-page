## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to get a better understanding of the CSS `position` property, especially when it comes to working with the `relative` and `absolute` values.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```
```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
}
```

When the parent element is set to relative positioning, using position absolute on the child element will position the element relative to the parent element and not the html element.
